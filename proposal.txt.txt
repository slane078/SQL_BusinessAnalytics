Project 2 Proposal:

	Current e-commerce sites can sometimes focus on the wrong data, giving their leadership and company a sense that REGISTERED USERS will be the driving force of marketplace health. What we plan to show is that Recency is the true driving force of a marketplace business - essentially your total user count doesn’t matter, it’s your frequent users that will be the “north star” from which your business can rely on growth.

For our project, we will use data from a real company database, bstock.com. Our plan is to pull data from 3 of the top 5 marketplaces to see how new users’ activity and spend compare to those that have registered outside of our time restraints.

Our ETL will work as follows:
·	Use company’s existing MySQL Database to extract tables that will have monthly data on the amount of approved users, bids created, and auctions won for our marketplaces. 
·	The data will be in monthly steps over the course of 1/1/2018 to 12/31/2018. 
·	Once we’ve extracted for one site, we will use the same code to pull data for the other 2 sites.
·	We will also pull total data numbers for our sites to compare to the timeframe above.
·	We will then load our data into 3 csv files for loading into our javascript code.

Our workplan will be:
·	ETL data and define our 3 visualizations
·	Visualizations: Line graph, bar graph, dynamic funnel visualizing conversion rates for each step of the user journey
·	Create HTML/CSS/JS to contain our site and visualizations, including a write up on how the user journey will flow on our site.
·	Create presentation around how our data was structured, loaded, and the storytelling of our data.

We plan to show that a user who is new and recent will be more valuable per capita than the total of registered users outside of our dataset. Our story will be around how a business can see a clearer view of their actual userbase, and how a user’s journey will tell a better story than the largest number found.
